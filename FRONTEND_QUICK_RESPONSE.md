# Quick Response as Frontend Team

## Send This Now:

```
Backend Team,

Thanks for the 1-2 month estimate. Before we communicate this timeline to stakeholders, can you help us understand the breakdown?

Specifically, how long for:
1. GET /leads endpoint only (no create/update, just read)
2. Adding a lead_value field to the database 
3. GET /admin/stats that returns: {totalLeads: X, revenue: Y}

We assumed these were basic database queries. What makes them take months?

If it helps, we can work with ANY data format you provide - our frontend is flexible.

Could we possibly get just GET /leads working this week as a starting point?

Thanks,
Frontend Team
```

## If They Still Say Months, Send This:

```
Backend Team,

We need to level-set expectations. Our frontend is complete and stakeholders are asking why the system doesn't work.

For context, we've seen similar endpoints built in:
- Startups: 2-3 days
- Enterprises: 1-2 weeks  
- With full testing: 3 weeks max

Can we explore alternatives:
1. Mock endpoints with fake data (few hours?)
2. Simplified version without all features
3. Additional resources to help
4. Third-party solutions (Firebase, Supabase)

The business needs something working soon. How can we deliver value faster?

Hi [Manager],

Quick escalation - the backend team estimates 1-2 months for basic CRUD endpoints that return database data. 

For reference, this is typically 1-2 weeks of work. We're concerned about:
- Business impact of 2-month delay
- Whether the requirements are understood
- If we need additional resources

Our frontend is complete and tested. We just need basic endpoints to display data.

Can we discuss options?

Thanks,
Frontend Team
