# Frontend Development Roadmap
## MVA CRM System - Next Phase Implementation

### Overview
This roadmap outlines the frontend development tasks that can be completed while waiting for backend endpoints. All features should be built with mock data first, then integrated with real APIs when available.

---

## Week 1: Core Infrastructure & Lead Assignment

- [x] Create mock API service (`js/mock-api.js`)
- [ ] Set up development/staging environment detection
- [ ] Create feature flags system for gradual rollout
- [ ] Implement API versioning support

### Day 3-4: Lead Assignment System
- [x] Build lead assignment UI module (`js/lead-assignment.js`)
- [ ] Add assignment modal to admin dashboard
- [ ] Implement bulk selection UI
- [ ] Create agent capacity visualization
- [ ] Add assignment history tracking

### Day 5: Testing & Polish
- [ ] Test lead assignment with mock data
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Implement optimistic UI updates
- [ ] Create unit tests for assignment logic

## Week 4: Polish & Production Readiness

### Day 1-2: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- [ ] Add pagination to all data tables
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Implement lazy loading
- [ ] Add service worker for offline support

### Day 3-4: Accessibility & UX
- [ ] Complete ARIA labels
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation
- [ ] Implement focus management
- [ ] Create loading skeletons for all components
- [ ] Add empty states

### Day 5: Documentation & Handoff
- [ ] Document all new components
- [ ] Create integration guide

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Mock-First Development
```javascript
// Always start with mock data
const mockLeads = await mockAPI.getLeads();

// Then switch to real API when available
const leads = await api.getLeads(); 
```

### 2. Component Structure
```
components/
├── lead-assignment/
│   ├── LeadAssignment.js
│   ├── AgentSelector.js
│   ├── BulkActions.js
│   └── styles.css
├── filters/
│   ├── AdvancedFilters.js
│   ├── DateRangePicker.js
│   └── FilterPresets.js
└── shared/
    ├── Modal.js
    ├── Toast.js
    └── LoadingStates.js
```

### 3. State Management Pattern
```javascript
// Use consistent state management
class FeatureModule {
    constructor() {
        this.state = {
            data: [],
            loading: false,
            error: null,
            filters: {}
        };
    }
    
    setState(updates) {
        this.state = { ...this.state, ...updates };
        this.render();
    }
}
```

### 4. Error Handling Strategy
```javascript
// Consistent error handling
try {
    const result = await api.call();
    // Handle success
} catch (error) {
    // Log to error tracker
    errorTracker.captureError(error);
    
    // Show user-friendly message
    this.showToast('Something went wrong. Please try again.');
    
    // Fallback to cached data if available
    this.loadFromCache();
}
```

### 5. Testing Checklist
- [ ] Unit tests for business logic
- [ ] Integration tests with mock API
- [ ] Accessibility testing
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
