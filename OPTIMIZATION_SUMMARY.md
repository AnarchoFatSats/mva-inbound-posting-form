### Browser Loading Strategy
1. **HTML** loads first with inline critical CSS
2. **Critical JavaScript** loads asynchronously
3. **Service Worker** registers for caching
4. **Modules** load in parallel:
   - Utils (shared functions)
   - Service Worker Manager
   - Search (advanced search features)
   - Pagination (data management)
   - Charts (visual components)
5. **Non-critical CSS** loads asynchronously
6. **Main app** loads last, orchestrates everything

### Performance Monitoring
- Search timing tracked and displayed
- Service worker cache statistics
- CSS optimization reports
- Performance.now() used for accurate measurements
- Loading states provide user feedback
- Git commits track optimization history
