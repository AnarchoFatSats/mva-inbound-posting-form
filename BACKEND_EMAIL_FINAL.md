Hi Backend Team,

Thank you for fixing the authentication CORS issues - users can now successfully log in! However, I need to clarify some confusion about the overall system requirements and why we're documenting additional endpoints.

## Quick Summary: Why All These Changes?

**You fixed the front door (login), but the house is empty (no data/features).**

## Understanding the Complete System

What you might not have realized is that this project was always a **complete CRM platform**, not just an authentication system. The authentication fix was simply Step 1 of getting the full system operational.

### What Was Built (The Full CRM):
1. **Login System** ✅ - You just fixed this, works great!
2. **Lead Management Dashboard** ❌ - Built but can't fetch data (CORS blocking)
3. **Premium Admin Analytics** ❌ - Built but endpoints don't exist

### This Isn't New Scope
- All frontend features have been built and deployed for months
- The UI is sitting there waiting for backend endpoints
- Users expect a complete CRM when they log in, not an empty dashboard

## Current User Experience

```
What Happens Now:
1. "Great, I can finally log in!" ✅
2. "Why is my dashboard empty?" ❌
3. "Where are my leads?" ❌
4. "Why are all the numbers showing $0?" ❌
```

Think of it like fixing Netflix's login screen, but there are no movies to watch after logging in. The movie player UI exists, but there's no movie data.

## What Needs to Be Fixed (Priority Order)

### 1. TODAY - Fix CORS on `/leads/*` endpoints (30 minutes)
- **Why:** So agents can see and manage leads
- **How:** Apply the same CORS fix you used for auth endpoints
- **Test:** Try `fetch('https://9qtb4my1ij.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/leads')` from the frontend

### 2. THIS WEEK - Add Missing Database Field
- **Add:** `lead_value` field to leads table (default: $35)
- **Why:** All revenue calculations show $0 without this

### 3. THIS WEEK - Build Two Basic Endpoints

**Endpoint 1:** `GET /admin/stats`
```json
{
  "revenue": { "total": 42350, "change": 12 },
  "agents": { "total": 23, "online": 12 },
  "conversion": { "rate": 68, "change": 5 }
}
```

**Endpoint 2:** `GET /admin/analytics?period=week`
```json
{
  "labels": ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"],
  "leads": [45, 52, 48, 61, 55, 42, 38],
  "revenue": [1575, 1820, 1680, 2135, 1925, 1470, 1330]
}
```

### 4. NEXT WEEK - Complete Remaining Features
We can discuss the full roadmap once basic functionality is working.

## Answering Your Concerns

**"Is this scope creep?"**  
No, this is the original project scope. We built a complete CRM frontend assuming these backend endpoints existed. The auth fix just revealed they don't.

**"Why wasn't this communicated earlier?"**  
We didn't realize the backend was incomplete until users couldn't see data after logging in. The CORS errors masked the missing endpoints.

**"This seems like a lot of work"**  
The good news: You've already done the hardest part (auth + CORS pattern). Now it's just:
- Apply CORS fix to other endpoints (30 min)
- Build a few new endpoints (few days)

## Business Impact

Our customers are paying for a complete CRM. They can now log in (thanks to your fix!), but the product doesn't work beyond that. They're seeing an expensive dashboard with no data.

## Proposed Next Steps

1. **Today:** Check and fix CORS on `/leads/*` endpoints
2. **Confirm:** Let us know if lead data starts loading
3. **This Week:** Add `lead_value` field and build 2 MVP endpoints
4. **Communicate:** Share realistic timeline for remaining features

## Simple Test You Can Run

Open the browser console on https://main.d21xta9fg9b6w.amplifyapp.com and run:

```javascript
// This works now (you fixed it):
await fetch('https://9qtb4my1ij.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/auth/login')

// This probably fails with CORS:
await fetch('https://9qtb4my1ij.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/leads')
```

## We're Here to Help

I know this seems like a lot, but we can work together iteratively. Fix CORS first (quick win), then we'll test each endpoint as you build it. The frontend is flexible and will adapt to whatever data structure you provide.

Please let me know:
1. Can you check the `/leads/*` CORS today?
2. Do you need any clarification on the endpoint requirements?
3. What's a realistic timeline for the MVP endpoints?

Thanks for your patience as we work through this. The authentication fix was a huge step forward - now let's get the rest of the system working!

P.S. I've attached detailed documentation about each endpoint requirement if you need it, but focus on the CORS fix first - that will unlock basic functionality immediately.
