Subject: URGENT: API Gateway CORS Configuration Blocking Frontend Application
Priority: Critical - Application is Non-Functional

Dear Backend Team,

The frontend application at https://main.d21xta9fg9b6w.amplifyapp.com is completely blocked from accessing the API due to incorrect CORS configuration in API Gateway. The application cannot function until this is fixed.

THE PROBLEM:
- API Gateway returns 403 on OPTIONS requests (preflight checks)
- Browser security (CORS) requires OPTIONS to succeed before any API call
- Result: Zero API calls can be made from the frontend

Current: OPTIONS request → 403 "Missing Authentication Token"
Expected: OPTIONS request → 200 OK with CORS headers

THE FIX (10-15 minutes):

1. Log into AWS Console → API Gateway
2. Select your API (ID: 9qtb4my1ij)
3. For EACH resource (/leads, /auth/*, /stats, /export, etc.):
   - Click the resource
   - Actions → Enable CORS
   - Configure:
     * Origin: https://main.d21xta9fg9b6w.amplifyapp.com
     * Headers: Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token
     * Methods: GET,POST,PATCH,DELETE,OPTIONS
   - Click Save
4. Deploy the API:
   - Actions → Deploy API
   - Stage: prod
   - Deploy

VERIFICATION:
After deployment, this test should return 200 OK:
curl -X OPTIONS https://9qtb4my1ij.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/leads -H "Origin: https://main.d21xta9fg9b6w.amplifyapp.com" -v

IMPACT:
- Application is 100% non-functional
- Users cannot log in or see any data
- Revenue loss every hour this remains broken

Please implement within 2 hours. The frontend is fully deployed and waiting. Once you enable CORS, the application will immediately start working.

Happy to jump on a call if you need any clarification.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this critical issue.

Best regards,
