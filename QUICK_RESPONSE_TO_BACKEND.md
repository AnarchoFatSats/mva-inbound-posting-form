**Subject:** Re: CRM Endpoints - Let's Build the MVP Together

Hi Backend Team,

Thanks for confirming the endpoints don't exist. We understand this is bigger than expected.

**Our Proposal:**
Let's build an MVP in phases rather than everything at once.

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):** Just `/leads` CRUD
- GET /leads (with pagination)
- POST /leads  
- PATCH /leads/{id}
- GET /leads/{id}

**Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4):** Basic Admin
- GET /admin/stats (simple totals)
- GET /admin/analytics (basic charts)

**Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6):** Agencies
- GET /agencies (basic list)

**What We'll Do:**
- Provide clear API specs
- Test as you build
- Adapt our frontend to your structure
- No scope creep, promise!

**Can you start with the `/leads` endpoints this week?** Even basic versions would unblock us.

We're flexible and patient. Let's build something that works, then improve it over time.

Ready when you are!
