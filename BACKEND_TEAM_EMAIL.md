# Email to Backend Team - URGENT: API Gateway CORS Fix Required

**To:** Backend Development Team  
**Subject:** URGENT: API Gateway CORS Configuration Blocking Frontend Application  
**Priority:** Critical - Application is Non-Functional  

---

## Executive Summary

The frontend application at https://main.d21xta9fg9b6w.amplifyapp.com is completely blocked from accessing the API due to incorrect CORS configuration in API Gateway. **The application cannot function until this is fixed.**

## The Problem

1. **API Gateway returns 403 on OPTIONS requests** (preflight checks)
2. Browser security (CORS) requires OPTIONS to succeed before any API call
3. Result: **Zero API calls can be made from the frontend**

### Current Behavior:
```
OPTIONS https://9qtb4my1ij.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/leads
→ 403 Forbidden: "Missing Authentication Token"
```

### Expected Behavior:
```
OPTIONS https://9qtb4my1ij.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/leads
→ 200 OK with CORS headers
```

## The Fix (10-15 minutes)

### Option 1: AWS Console (Recommended)

1. **Log into AWS Console** → API Gateway
2. **Select your API** (ID: 9qtb4my1ij)
3. **For EACH resource** (/leads, /auth/*, /stats, /export, etc.):
   - Click the resource
   - Actions → **Enable CORS**
   - Configure:
     ```
     Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://main.d21xta9fg9b6w.amplifyapp.com
     Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type,X-Amz-Date,Authorization,X-Api-Key,X-Amz-Security-Token
     Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,POST,PATCH,DELETE,OPTIONS
     ```
   - Click **Save**
4. **Deploy the API**:
   - Actions → Deploy API
   - Stage: **prod**
   - Deploy

### Option 2: Serverless Framework

If using serverless.yml, update each endpoint:

```yaml
functions:
  api:
    handler: index.handler
    events:
      - http:
          path: /leads
          method: ANY
          cors:
            origin: 'https://main.d21xta9fg9b6w.amplifyapp.com'
            headers:
              - Content-Type
              - X-Api-Key
              - Authorization
            allowCredentials: false
      - http:
          path: /leads/{id}
          method: ANY
          cors:
            origin: 'https://main.d21xta9fg9b6w.amplifyapp.com'
            headers:
              - Content-Type
              - X-Api-Key
              - Authorization
            allowCredentials: false
```

Then deploy: `serverless deploy --stage prod`

## Verification Test

After deployment, run this test:

```bash
curl -X OPTIONS https://9qtb4my1ij.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/leads \
  -H "Origin: https://main.d21xta9fg9b6w.amplifyapp.com" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: x-api-key" \
  -v
```

**Should return:**
- Status: 200 OK
- Headers include: `access-control-allow-origin: https://main.d21xta9fg9b6w.amplifyapp.com`

## Impact of Not Fixing

- **Application is 100% non-functional**
- Users cannot log in
- No data can be displayed
- All API operations fail
- **Revenue loss every hour this remains broken**

## Technical Details

The Lambda function already returns CORS headers correctly. The issue is API Gateway is blocking OPTIONS requests before they reach Lambda. This is a gateway-level configuration issue, not a code issue.

## Timeline

**Please implement within 2 hours.** The frontend is fully deployed and waiting. Once you enable CORS, the application will immediately start working.

## Questions?

Happy to provide any additional details or join a call to walk through the fix.

**Note:** This is blocking all users from accessing the application. Please treat as highest priority.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.
