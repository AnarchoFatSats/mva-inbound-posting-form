BACKEND TEAM - QUICK FIX NEEDED
================================

PROBLEM: API Gateway blocks OPTIONS requests → App can't work

FIX (10 minutes):
1. AWS Console → API Gateway → Your API (9qtb4my1ij)
2. For each endpoint: Actions → Enable CORS
3. Set origin: https://main.d21xta9fg9b6w.amplifyapp.com
4. Deploy API to prod

TEST:
curl -X OPTIONS [your-api-url]/prod/leads -H "Origin: [frontend-url]"
Should return 200 OK (not 403)

IMPACT: App is 100% broken until this is fixed

That's it. Everything else is ready.
