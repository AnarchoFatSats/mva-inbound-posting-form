# Phase 3: Performance Optimization Plan

## Overview
Phase 3 focuses on optimizing the CRM system for maximum performance, ensuring smooth operation even with large datasets and multiple concurrent users. This phase will implement advanced optimization techniques while maintaining the excellent UI/UX achieved in previous phases.

## Performance Goals
- Initial page load: < 3 seconds
- Time to Interactive (TTI): < 5 seconds
- First Contentful Paint (FCP): < 1.5 seconds
- Lighthouse Performance Score: > 90
- Memory usage: < 50MB baseline
- Smooth 60fps animations

## Implementation Components

### 1. Code Splitting & Lazy Loading
**Priority: High**

- Conditional feature loading based on user roles

### 2. Bundle Optimization
**Priority: High**
- Webpack configuration optimization
- Tree shaking for unused code
- Minification and compression
- Module concatenation
- Vendor bundle optimization

### 3. Caching Strategy
**Priority: High**
- Service Worker implementation
- Cache-first strategies for static assets
- API response caching
- LocalStorage optimization
- IndexedDB for large datasets

### 4. Virtual Scrolling
**Priority: High**
- Implement for tables with 1000+ rows
- Infinite scroll for activity feeds
- Dynamic row rendering
- Viewport-based rendering

### 5. Web Workers
**Priority: Medium**
- Background data processing
- Export generation in workers
- Search indexing
- Heavy calculations offloading

### 6. Asset Optimization
**Priority: Medium**
